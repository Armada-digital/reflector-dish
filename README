Reflector Dish
==============

Inspired by Jonathan 'Wolf' Rentzsch's Twitter Reflector Dish used for the C4 
conference. http://github.com/rentzsch/TwitterReflectorDish

Reflector Dish is a conference backchannel in a box. 


Overview
--------

The Reflector Dish retweets messages from members of a given list containing a 
specified #hashtag. 

*This document is a work in progress.*


Why?

The use of a Reflector Dish inhibits hashtag spamming during the event. 


Usage

Quick example:

    >> npm install oauth-client
    >> node reflector-dish.js your_account username/list_name hashtag

For @secondconf, I ran:

    >> node reflector-dish.js secondconf secondconf/attendees 2c
