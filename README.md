Reflector Dish
==============

Inspired by Jonathan 'Wolf' Rentzsch's Twitter Reflector Dish used for the C4 
conference. http://github.com/rentzsch/TwitterReflectorDish

Reflector Dish is a conference backchannel in a box. 


Overview
--------

The Reflector Dish retweets messages from members of a given list containing a 
specified #hashtag. 

*This document is a work in progress.*


Why?
----

The use of a Reflector Dish inhibits hashtag spamming during the event. 


Installation
------------

    >> git clone git://github.com/dlkinney/reflector-dish.git
    >> cd reflector-dish
    >> npm install oauth-client

Twitter's developer agreement prevents me from including the Reflector Dish's 
consumer key and secret in an open source project. You will need to join 
Twitter's developer program and getting your own consumer key and secret: 
http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

Once you have the consumer key and secret, create a file at 
``data/consumer_tokens``. Place the key on the first line and the secret on the 
second line. For an example of what that file should like: 

    >> cat data/consumer_tokens
    bTg4XWl5CWkfdaZN5tdwjN
    s2Lv5HQaPoXadyRoTx4Tf5kjCHeUCAirzkFYBftn2j

Once you have that file in place, you are ready to use the Reflector Dish.


Usage
-----

Quick example:

    >> node reflector-dish.js your_account username/list_name hashtag

For @secondconf, I ran:

    >> node reflector-dish.js secondconf secondconf/attendees 2c
